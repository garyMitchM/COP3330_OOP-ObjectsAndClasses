This repository contains Java code demonstrating the fundamentals of creating classes and instantiating objects that I turned in for the class
COP3330 Object-Oriented Programming at Valencia College. 

Restaurant App includes two restaurants that are able to manage orders, revenue, or inventory.
Dave's Hot Chicken requires an order number, the kind of entr√©e, the heat level, and the price.
Chipotle requires the type of meal, the inventory of bowls and tortillas, the kind of meat, and the guacamole price. 

The values for each restaurant can be updated using various method calls and then displayed to the command-line.
